# FizzBuzz Problem Solution

## Problem Statement

**[15 points]** - Write a solution to the "FizzBuzz" problem. The FizzBuzz problem is a classic programming interview problem in which a range of numbers is examined to locate those numbers divisible by 3 and 5. If the number is divisible by 3, then print "Fizz." If the number is divisible by 5, then print "Buzz." If it is divisible by both, then print "FizzBuzz." Otherwise, just print the number.

The task is to start at 1 and stop at 150 inclusive.

## Solution(theoretically, the code is in the same repo as the markdown file )

To solve the FizzBuzz problem, you need to iterate through the numbers from 1 to 150 (inclusive) and apply the following rules:

- If a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz."
- If a number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz."
- If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz."
- Otherwise, print the number itself.
